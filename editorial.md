# The stories cops tell about themselves
Data is one of the foremost languages of power, including police power. Few policy proposals can be considered ~~~serious~~~ unless they are based on so-called "hard data," as numbers still retain an aura of mathematical and scientific objectivity even in the face of countless studies and arguments demonstrating the dubiousness of many "data-driven" claims. From logical leaps to incomplete information to deliberate falsification, data can be and has been used to justify practically any faulty conclusion in virtually every field. The need for caution is especially great when the data in question is a direct product of oppressive institutions with every motivation to present a biased image of their own activities.

Nevertheless, significant knowledge can and should be obtained by interrogating the self-reported data of the New York Police Department (NYPD) and other agencies of our local repressive state apparatus. Since "we treasure what we measure," abolitionists can gain insight into the priorities of our foes by critically examining what they record—and don't record. By cross-comparing various datasets and public statements, we can highlight inconsistencies in police claims to provide the community safety we already know is not their true purpose or outcome. Broad patterns imperceptible to individual experience or community-scale discussion can become apparent by summarizing large datasets, via visualization or via other means. And sometimes, the sheer absurdity represented by certain abstractions of complex human realities can provide some much-needed comic relief.

_The Stories Cops Tell About Themselves_ examines NYPD arrest, complaint and budget data from TK TK-2019.[^0] We offer it as an exploration of how data shapes imaginations and in turn constructs worlds, not as an analysis with claims to finality or completeness.


# The stories we tell about the cops
Now we are confronted with not just the stories that cops tell about themselves, but also the stories we tell ourselves about the cops to justify their existence. Looking at the complaint data, we can see that when people called the cops, police were only able to stop less than 2 percent of "crimes." Some people know very well that calling the police often leads to further disappointment and violence—we can look to people of oppressed gender experience for examples of where police have failed in addressing issues of gender-based violence like [sexual assault](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/rape-victims-kits-police-departments.html) or in other circumstances been perpetuators of [sexual violence](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/30/nypd-anna-chambers-rape-probation/) themselves, among many other serious "crimes" that they claim to be fighting against and protecting us from. What's missing from the picture here are the many people in the states who have _never_ actually called the police and or witnessed the reality of how police actually operate, which allows them to hold onto fantasies of what would happen if they did call 911, as abolitionist Mariame Kaba said.[^1]

We live in a particular iteration of society where violent entities of command and control are taking up space in our imagination as agents of safety who come to our rescue when Big Bad Things happen. A shift in our collective understanding which shows that cops don't actually keep everyone safe, means that we must channel our dissillusionment into actively defining what safety means and shaping how to keep each other safe in the here and now as well as the future. Amidst the throes of mass demands to [#DefundThePolice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html), it can be easy to lose sight of a bigger abolitionist picture and center the data or get caught up in abstract discussions about budget line items. What does eliminating $1 billion dollars[^2] mean to an $11 billion police budget[^3] and $11 billion jail budget[^4] in New York City? As abolitionists who believe in investing in communities by way of transformative justice[^5], free social services for all (including, but not limited to healthcare, housing, public transportation, education) and the abolition of police and prisons—we also believe in the abolition of big data.[^6] 

In recent years, police departments have become more data driven and we run the risk of them doubling down on increasing police power by way of precision policing[^8], predictive policing and surveillance. Reformist[^7] demands for transparency and accountability have resulted in government funded [task forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Task_Force_on_21st_Century_Policing) and other initiatives to document police activity, spending and efficacy. The data referenced in this project was collected by the NYPD and is accessible from both [NYC Open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/NYPD/fjn5-bxwg) and the NYPD.[^8] We interpret police data as a peak into how police view themselves, or rather, what police are comfortable sharing about themselves with the public. As two Black people and one white race traitor, we strongly believe we cannot trust the police. The police lie when they harass us in the streets and fabricate charges, so why wouldn’t they lie in their data? As long as police exist, there will always be contradictions between how police portray themselves and how we as vulnerable targets understand them. No amount of data can capture our experiences or the level of codification on the part of police and carceral legal system that consisitenly invalidate our experiences in the name of law. No amount of data can capture the larger function of the police as a psychological hold on not only our (mis)understandings of safety, community and accountability, but also a deeper history of the enslavement of Black people and the protection of white control over property.
