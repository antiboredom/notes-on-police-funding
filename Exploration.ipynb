    "### Notes on crime types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The lowest-level theft offense in New York is called \"petit larceny,\" or petty theft, which is the unlawful taking of property or services valued at no more than $1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each arrest costs around 24,000 in person hours, or 519,048,000 total for all petty theft arrests. Let's say that each petit theft was in fact for the maximum 1000, meaning the total value of goods stolen is 21,627,000. This means that if the city simply reimbursed for lost property instead of arresting people it would save New York 497,421,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"assault 3\" is assault in the 3rd degree: \"Assault in the third degree is the top charge when there are only minor injuries, weapons are not used, and the victim does not fall into a special protected category\" (SCUFFLES)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Escape 3: A person is guilty of escape in the third degree when he escapes from custody!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I am confused about \"OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC ADMINI\" - it seems to encompass a ton of stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"Theft of services\" (4194 arrests) can include riding public transit without a pass"
